# YOLOv7 Plate Detection

YOLOv7 is a single-stage real-time object detector. It was introduced to the YOLO family in Julyâ€™22. According to the YOLOv7 paper, it is the fastest and most accurate real-time object detector to date. YOLOv7 established a significant benchmark by taking its performance up a notch.

In this project, contains YOLOv7 on plate detection and recognition We will go through the YOLOv7 GitHub repository and using on our project.
